Hello World
  <h1>
    This is the header
  </h1>
  <p>
    My "cause" is inequalities such as treating people differently because they have different races, genders, beliefs,... I want 
    everyone to be treated fairly. I have friends, male friends, who want to wear dresses and grow long hair. I saw people look at 
    them with different eyes. And I don't understand why. They're good people, and how they dressed don't make them bad. I'm an 
    international student, and I received warnings that when I'm here in the U.S, I'll probably encounter lots of unfair things. 
    Because I'm Asian, I'm not white, my hair is not blonde, my eyes are not green or blue. I want to make things different. A 
    person is a person and how they look or what they believe in doesn't make them a bad person. I want everyone to understand that.
